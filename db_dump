2	Swift: Building iOS Apps	Flatiron School	We’ll start with the fundamentals of Swift and move on to more advanced topics like Higher Order Functions, Protocols, and Extensions. Write, run, and view your code in Xcode and learn how to read warning and error messages. Use Interface Builder and Auto Layout to build interactive, visually stunning applications.	https://flatironschool.imgix.net/online-swift/build-ios-applications-v2.jpg?fit=crop&crop=entropy	https://flatironschool.com/programs/online-swift-free-course/	https://gitter.im/ML-LIME/Swift
3	UX Design for Mobile Developers	Udacity	This course is optimized for the developer who is looking to efficiently learn the most important design techniques that will help them make better apps (with a focus on mobile/Android). This is a UX design course built for current (and aspiring) mobile developers. In this short course, you'll step back from your IDE and dive into the techniques that great designers use to plan and prototype amazing apps before any code is written.	https://www.udacity.com/assets/pages/cop/nd801-366a1965b856969997591244b5bad242a2bc5f91f72f0c4275a53ed1d600406a.jpg	https://www.udacity.com/course/ux-design-for-mobile-developers--ud849	https://gitter.im/ML-LIME/UX-Design
4	Intro to JavaScript	Flatiron School	You’ll build a Konami code program and a working game in JavaScript (and we promise it’s not yet-another-Blackjack clone!). You’ll also master the latest JavaScript syntax and techniques, an essential base for launching into further learning.	https://flatironschool.imgix.net/online-intro-to-javascript-free/course-graphics-expand-your-skills.jpg?fit=crop&crop=entropy	https://flatironschool.com/programs/online-intro-javascript-free-course/	https://gitter.im/ML-LIME/JavaScript
1	How to Create Anything in Android	Udacity	Here is one important question Android developers ask while making apps: 'How can I do ________ in Android?' The following are versions of this question that we came across recently: How can I add radio buttons to my app? How can I play a sound? How can I navigate between multiple screens? This course is a collection of such questions and their answers. By the end of this course you will have mastered the ability to implement new Android features by reading a blog or article — this is a critical skill possessed by professional Android developers. As a result, you will also be able to use several User Interface components — like Toggle Buttons, Menus, Grid View and many more — that are central to making functional and delightful Android apps.	https://www.udacity.com/assets/pages/cop/nd801-366a1965b856969997591244b5bad242a2bc5f91f72f0c4275a53ed1d600406a.jpg	https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-create-anything-in-android--ud802	https://gitter.im/ML-LIME/Android
